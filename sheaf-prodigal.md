# Sheaf: Prodigal

Then Scythian warriors did toss their blades,

Unruffled by Orcus' pugnacious shades,

And grasped his brother each in shepherd hug,

A Cossack's embrace flung upon Goth's rug. 

Boys collided in affection's relief,

A retrieval of the lost past belief!

The elder had hunted in the darkness,

And liberty forswore in pits' starkness;

The younger was in ruin desolate,

And his joy in Riah was consummate.

"Behold, we are Khan!" did Uriah roar

To the spectators of butchery's gore.

"This Schlacht: my brother, the prodigal he!

My ward by father's charge -- scion I be!

Here I deposit his redemption's price --

To wager our lives with arena's dice!"

But Jeshurun did raise Uriah's arm,

Fist by fist clench'ed against Orcus' harm,

And defiance spat: "Brethren, life or death!

Who shall the Khans part? Unto lungs' last breath!

Come then, o world -- we shall sting thee and die!"

Thus Thorn and Stalk did publicize kin's tie.
